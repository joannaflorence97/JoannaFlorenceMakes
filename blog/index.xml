I have stitched it in a 5&amp;quot; hoop on calico fabric but I also think it would look great on a tote bag, on a denim jacket, or as a patch.
You can download the pattern below. To fit the pattern in a 5&amp;quot; hoop make sure your printer does not scale the page, but feel free to scale if you would like the pattern to be smaller or larger.</description></item></channel></rss>
