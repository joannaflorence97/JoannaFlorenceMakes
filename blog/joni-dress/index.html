It features a flattering empire waistline with a beautiful twist on the front as well as a full circle skirt. The pattern also comes with a choice of sleeves to choose from: three-quarter length, elbow-length, flared or even ruched.</p><p>I opted for the flared sleeves, although I didn&rsquo;t make them as flared as suggested in the book. The book tells you how to create the pattern for the flared sleeves and in step 2 tells you to spread the pieces 10cm (4in) apart. I opted for 8cm instead and I love the amount of flare my sleeves have.</p><p>The fabric I used was is from <a href=https://poundfabrics.co.uk/>Pound Fabrics</a> and is a soft cotton jersey. At first it was a bit of a pain to sew with as my machine kept eating it but after attaching my walking foot it was easy.</p><p>I did get a bit stuck right at the end, when attaching my completed bodice piece to my completed skirt piece. All was fine until I tried it on and heard &ldquo;snap!&rdquo;&mldr; Actually I heard quite a few snaps! I was using a zig zag stitch and the thread just couldn&rsquo;t take the stretch needed to get the dress on over my head and shoulders. I tried again after changing the settings and once again&mldr; &ldquo;snap!&rdquo;. I got upset at this point and decided it was best I take a break!</p><p>I turned to the sewing community on Instagram and got some great advice and encouragement. I had been using my sewing machine (not my overlocker) for the dress because I was a bit nervous that the overlocker wouldn&rsquo;t like the elastic and it had only just come out of repair! I took the plunge and sewed together the bodice and skirt with the elastic on the overlocker&mldr; and it worked just fine! Sometimes you just have to go for it!</p><p>The fabric I used was quite stretchy and some good advice I got was that maybe I didn&rsquo;t even need to use the elastic as I could easily get the dress on without it. However, it really depends on the stretch recovery of the fabric as for this it would need to be one that &ldquo;pings&rdquo; back easily and won&rsquo;t lose it&rsquo;s shape over multiple wears.</p><div class=blog-image-framed><img src=/img/joni2.JPG alt>
<span class=caption></span></div><p>The pattern has great, easy-to-follow steps and I didn&rsquo;t get stuck at all in knowing what to do. The twist is easier than it looks but if you do find yourself stuck on this pattern there are some great Youtube tutorials you can follow. I had a look just to check that I was doing the twist correctly (I need to stop doubting myself!).</p><p>The only downside to this pattern: no pockets. But I feel like you could easily hack those in. To be honest, I just forgot!</p><p>The dress fit me perfectly without having to make a single adjustment. It&rsquo;s just beautiful and I want to swirl around in it forever! I now just need something to wear it to!</p><hr><div class=sharethis-inline-share-buttons></div></div></div></div><div class=col-md-12><div class="comments text-left padDiv mb-30"><div class=entry-comments><div class=fb-comments data-href=https://www.joannaflorencemakes.com/blog/joni-dress/ data-width=100% data-numposts=5></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><div id=footer class=text-center><div class=container><div class="socials-media text-center"><ul class=list-unstyled><li><a href=https://instagram.com/joannaflorencemakes><i class="bi bi-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/@joannaflorencemakes><i class="bi bi-youtube"></i></a></li></ul></div><p>&copy; Copyright Joanna Florence Laikin 2024.
