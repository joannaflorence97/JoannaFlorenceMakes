I was mainly intrigued by the &ldquo;bagging out&rdquo; technique for the facing which I had never tried and wanted to learn.</p><p>The pattern I used is free to download as a PDF and is a very similar shell top to the one used in the episode. It can be found on Sew Mag&rsquo;s website <a href=https://www.sewmag.co.uk/free-sewing-patterns/sewing-bee-sleevless-shell-top>here</a>. In fact, I think this pattern is from a previous seris of The Sewing Bee!</p><p>The pattern is great for using up a left over bit of fabric as it only takes about a metre to a metre and a half, depending on the size you are making. I found a metre of this gorgeous peach crepe covered in royal blue foxes in my stash that I thought would look great as a shell top. This was just enough for me to cut out the top as well as the facings for the smallest size. Unfortunately, I went on to burn the facing with the iron (at least it wasn&rsquo;t the top!) and subsequently had to cut out the facings in a plain white cotton. I think the contrast actually works quite well. I didn&rsquo;t really think about how the fabric is very sheer so the facing is completely visible through it, but it works well with a white camisole underneath.</p><p>The pattern is simple and easy to follow. It describes the &ldquo;bagging out&rdquo; technique very well and I had no trouble creating a lovely neat finish using it. I had some trouble when I got to step 10 as I didn&rsquo;t really understand how it was telling me to finish the back. So in classic Joanna style, I winged it. I sewed the facing to the back seams, right sides together and turned them back out so that the ribbon hoop was on the outside of the garment. I then sewed the back seam from the hem to the bottom of the facing, right sides together, as it says to do in the pattern.</p><p>I decided to take up the hem at the back a bit as the dramatic scooped back was a bit too much for me. It&rsquo;s still curved on mine, but doesn&rsquo;t dip as low. For finishing the hem, the pattern tells you to zig zag over the raw edge, then fold over and stitch&mldr; but this just wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it for me. I think that would have looked a bit messy so I opted for a nice neat rolled hem.</p><p>Something I learnt whilst watching episode 2 of The Sewing Bee was that you can sew on buttons using a sewing machine (who&rsquo;d have thought it?!) and I finished the garment the morning after episode 2 aired by using this technique. I&rsquo;d previously sewn all buttons onto garments by hand, but this just looks so much neater and takes less than half the time!</p><p>When I showed off the finished garment to my boyfriend he called me out for not pattern matching - the cheek of it! There&rsquo;s only so much you can do with a metre of fabric.</p><p>Overall, this is a great basic Summer top that has a lovely straightfoward pattern with some good diagrams. I would recommend it for confident beginners to learn techniques such as darts, bagging out and sewing a button loop with a button.</p><div class=row><div class=col-md-6><img class=blog-image-framed src=/img/shell-top-2.jpg alt></div><div class=col-md-6><img class=blog-image-framed src=/img/shell-top-3.jpg alt></div></div><hr><div class=sharethis-inline-share-buttons></div></div></div></div><div class=col-md-12><div class="comments text-left padDiv mb-30"><div class=entry-comments><div class=fb-comments data-href=https://www.joannaflorencemakes.com/blog/shell-top/ data-width=100% data-numposts=5></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><div id=footer class=text-center><div class=container><div class="socials-media text-center"><ul class=list-unstyled><li><a href=https://instagram.com/joannaflorencemakes><i class="bi bi-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://www.etsy.com/shop/joannaflorencemakes/><i class="bi bi-shop"></i></a></li></ul></div><p>&copy; Copyright Joanna Florence Laikin 2023.
