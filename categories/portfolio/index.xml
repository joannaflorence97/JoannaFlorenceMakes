Then when I saw this pattern for a pinafore dress with large pockets and a pocket on the front I knew I had to make it!
The pattern used was Kwik Sew K4318.
Techniques I learnt in the process were:
Sewing a lapped zip. Turning corners neatly on an overlocker. Stitch in the ditch.</description></item><item><title>I love my dachshund!</title><link>/portfolio/sausage-dog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/sausage-dog/</guid><description>My friend was getting rid of a load of old bed sheets and in them was this gorgeous duvet cover printed with dachshunds, spots, bones and paw prints.
I love recycling fabric and it was great to use this black and tan dachshund as a focal point for a decorative hoop.
I&amp;rsquo;ve still got loads of the fabric left so it&amp;rsquo;ll definitely feature again in the future!
Stitches used: Chain stitch, stem stitch, back stitch.</description></item><item><title>Monochrome Blue</title><link>/portfolio/monochrome-girl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/monochrome-girl/</guid><description>In 2021 I&amp;rsquo;ve been particpating in the monthly @stitchthisinyourstyle challenge. I love this challenge because it really gets my creative juices flowing every month with a &amp;ldquo;prompt&amp;rdquo; to work into a design.
March&amp;rsquo;s prompt was &amp;ldquo;monochrome&amp;rdquo; so I stitched this &amp;ldquo;blue&amp;rdquo; girl using several different shades of blue.</description></item><item><title>Floral Asymmetrical Dress</title><link>/portfolio/floral-dress/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/floral-dress/</guid><description>This is actually the first dress I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully completed without giving up halfway through! I&amp;rsquo;ve had some sort of mental block about dresses until now. I’ve made plenty of tops and skirts but a dress just seemed like an entirely more difficult thing.
The pattern used was New Look 6507 (view C&amp;hellip; with the adition of a strap).
Techniques I learnt in the process were:
French seams. Making bias binding.</description></item><item><title>Galápagos penguin</title><link>/portfolio/galapagos-penguin/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/galapagos-penguin/</guid><description>One of the reasons I got into embroidery in the first place was because I saw thread-painted animals on Instagram and thought that they looked absolutely beautiful.
For a long while I put off this project because I was scared of doing an injustice to my favourite animal, the penguin. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier with how this turned out though!
This is a Galápagos penguin that I stitched as part of the February 2021 Endangered Species Challenge by @rabbithatdesigns.</description></item><item><title>A Sleepy Sloth</title><link>/portfolio/sloth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/sloth/</guid><description>I recently subscribed to Love Embroidery magazine and this beautiful pattern came in issue 10 (January 2021). It&amp;rsquo;s by Celeste Johnston of @lemon_made_shop and is printed in her book Freshly Stitched.</description></item><item><title>Spill the tea!</title><link>/portfolio/spill-the-tea/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/spill-the-tea/</guid><description>In 2021 I&amp;rsquo;ve been particpating in the monthly @stitchthisinyourstyle challenge.

Febuary&amp;rsquo;s prompt was &amp;ldquo;drink&amp;rdquo;. Because I’m British I obviously had to do something involving #tea.</description></item><item><title>Green Day Album Art</title><link>/portfolio/american-idiot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/american-idiot/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been enamoured with this album artwork and I saw it as a good design to practice my satin stitch.
I restarted this piece three times. Originally I drew the design onto some black fabric but found it difficult to see the design accurately and so switched to calico and coloured the black background with a Sharpie. I kind of love the rusticity of it and I definitely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have got that with a plain black fabric.</description></item></channel></rss>
