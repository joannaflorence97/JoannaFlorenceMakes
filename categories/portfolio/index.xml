It&amp;rsquo;s such a great pattern and the outcome is so gorgeous and comfortable at the same time due to the stretch. Last time I made it using the flared sleeve option, but this time I made fitted sleeves and extended them all the way down to my wrists. I&amp;rsquo;m so happy with the outcome&amp;hellip; what a great Christmas party dress!</description></item><item><title>Dachshund Dungarees</title><link>/portfolio/dachshund-dungarees/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/dachshund-dungarees/</guid><description>I made these custom dungarees for my sister Jay, who is modelling them here. Don&amp;rsquo;t you think she looks fab? The fabric is tapestry fabric covered in dachshunds! The pattern is K4138 by Kwik Sew. I have used the pattern before to sew the pinfore dress variation for myself. This took a lot of effort but I think it was worth it!</description></item><item><title>Skull Hoodie</title><link>/portfolio/skull-hoodie/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/skull-hoodie/</guid><description>This hoodie is so cosy, I never want to take it off!
The pattern is Stella, from the book Stretch by Tilly and the Buttons.
The fabric is French terry and was gifted to me by Minerva. I also lined the hood in plain black fleece for extra cosiness! I added a pattern-matched kangaroo pocket on the front.</description></item><item><title>Lyra Dress</title><link>/portfolio/lyra-dress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/lyra-dress/</guid><description>Yet another gorgeous dress by Tilly and the Buttons!
The variations I went for were:
Knee length dress. 3/4 length sleeves. The optional waist tie. The fabric I used was kindly gifted to me by Minerva.
I took my time to make this dress and I think because of that it turned out to be the best item that I have made to date!</description></item><item><title>Joni Dress</title><link>/portfolio/joni-dress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/joni-dress/</guid><description>The Joni pattern is by Tilly and the Buttons and features in the book Stretch!.
I am IN LOVE with this dress. It features a flattering empire waistline with a beautiful twist on the front as well as a full circle skirt. I opted for the flared sleeve variation.</description></item><item><title>Self Drafted Shirred Top</title><link>/portfolio/shirred-top/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/shirred-top/</guid><description>This pattern was entirely self drafted - yay!
The bodice was so simple to make and started as just two rectangles! The shirring took a long time but it creates a great fit and is so easy to wear.
My overlocker was in for repair when I made this so it was a great chance to practice my French seams!</description></item><item><title>Brighter Days Ahead Rainbow</title><link>/portfolio/brighter-days/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/brighter-days/</guid><description>This beautiful design is by Niamh Wimperis. I saw it on the cover of Mollie Makes magazine and knew I had to stitch it. I gifted it to my auntie for her birthday</description></item><item><title>Safiya Trousers</title><link>/portfolio/safiya-trousers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/safiya-trousers/</guid><description>These are the Safiya Trousers from the Tilly and the Button&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;Make it Simple&amp;rdquo;. They are super comfy. As the book says, it&amp;rsquo;s almost like I&amp;rsquo;m secretly wearing pyjamas!
With this pattern I also succeeded at pattern matching for the first time - yay!</description></item><item><title>The Amelia Tea Dress</title><link>/portfolio/amelia-dress/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/amelia-dress/</guid><description>I absolutely LOVE this pattern. It&amp;rsquo;s The Amelia Tea Dress by Simple Sew&amp;hellip; with a few hacks. Firstly, I added some big pockets and attached them in-seam at both the side seams and waist. Secondly, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough fabric for the original pattern I shortened the skirt pattern piece so I was still able to cut out a full circle skirt.
Techniques I learnt in the process were:</description></item><item><title>Be Kind to Your Mind</title><link>/portfolio/be-kind-to-your-mind/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/be-kind-to-your-mind/</guid><description>I first added watercolour to the unbleached calico fabric. Then I traced on my design and started stitching! I love this phrase and it&amp;rsquo;s definitely something I need to tell myself more often as I am always criticising my work and comparing myself to others. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that others can relate!</description></item><item><title>Strawberry Pinafore Dress</title><link>/portfolio/strawberry-dress/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Mar 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/strawberry-dress/</guid><description>When I saw this strawberry covered fabric I immediately thought about making a summery pinafore dress. Then when I saw this pattern for a pinafore dress with large pockets and a pocket on the front I knew I had to make it!
The pattern used was Kwik Sew K4318.
Techniques I learnt in the process were:
Sewing a lapped zip. Turning corners neatly on an overlocker. Stitch in the ditch. A refresher on gathering.</description></item><item><title>I love my dachshund!</title><link>/portfolio/sausage-dog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/sausage-dog/</guid><description>My friend was getting rid of a load of old bed sheets and in them was this gorgeous duvet cover printed with dachshunds, spots, bones and paw prints.
I love recycling fabric and it was great to use this black and tan dachshund as a focal point for a decorative hoop.
I&amp;rsquo;ve still got loads of the fabric left so it&amp;rsquo;ll definitely feature again in the future!
Stitches used: Chain stitch, stem stitch, back stitch.</description></item><item><title>Monochrome Blue</title><link>/portfolio/monochrome-girl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/monochrome-girl/</guid><description>In 2021 I&amp;rsquo;ve been particpating in the monthly @stitchthisinyourstyle challenge. I love this challenge because it really gets my creative juices flowing every month with a &amp;ldquo;prompt&amp;rdquo; to work into a design.
March&amp;rsquo;s prompt was &amp;ldquo;monochrome&amp;rdquo; so I stitched this &amp;ldquo;blue&amp;rdquo; girl using several different shades of blue.</description></item><item><title>Floral Asymmetrical Dress</title><link>/portfolio/floral-dress/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/floral-dress/</guid><description>This is actually the first dress I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully completed without giving up halfway through! I&amp;rsquo;ve had some sort of mental block about dresses until now. I’ve made plenty of tops and skirts but a dress just seemed like an entirely more difficult thing.
The pattern used was New Look 6507 (view C&amp;hellip; with the adition of a strap).
Techniques I learnt in the process were:
French seams. Making bias binding. Tricks for sewing over big chunky seams.</description></item><item><title>Galápagos penguin</title><link>/portfolio/galapagos-penguin/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/galapagos-penguin/</guid><description>One of the reasons I got into embroidery in the first place was because I saw thread-painted animals on Instagram and thought that they looked absolutely beautiful.
For a long while I put off this project because I was scared of doing an injustice to my favourite animal, the penguin. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier with how this turned out though!
This is a Galápagos penguin that I stitched as part of the February 2021 Endangered Species Challenge by @rabbithatdesigns.</description></item><item><title>A Sleepy Sloth</title><link>/portfolio/sloth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/sloth/</guid><description>I recently subscribed to Love Embroidery magazine and this beautiful pattern came in issue 10 (January 2021). It&amp;rsquo;s by Celeste Johnston of @lemon_made_shop and is printed in her book Freshly Stitched.</description></item><item><title>Spill the tea!</title><link>/portfolio/spill-the-tea/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/spill-the-tea/</guid><description>In 2021 I&amp;rsquo;ve been particpating in the monthly @stitchthisinyourstyle challenge. I love this challenge because it really gets my creative juices flowing every month with a &amp;ldquo;prompt&amp;rdquo; to work into a design.
Febuary&amp;rsquo;s prompt was &amp;ldquo;drink&amp;rdquo;. Because I’m British I obviously had to do something involving #tea.</description></item><item><title>My 2020 Mantra</title><link>/portfolio/things-wont/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/things-wont/</guid><description>2020 was a hard year for everyone and this phrase is what I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling myself throughout the entire pandemic.
Something I loved about doing this piece was the lettering. It took hours but it was so theraputic and totally worth it.</description></item><item><title>Green Day Album Art</title><link>/portfolio/american-idiot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/american-idiot/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been enamoured with this album artwork and I saw it as a good design to practice my satin stitch.
I restarted this piece three times. Originally I drew the design onto some black fabric but found it difficult to see the design accurately and so switched to calico and coloured the black background with a Sharpie. I kind of love the rusticity of it and I definitely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have got that with a plain black fabric.</description></item><item><title>Nope</title><link>/portfolio/nope/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/nope/</guid><description>In 2021 I&amp;rsquo;ve been particpating in the monthly @stitchthisinyourstyle challenge. I love this challenge because it really gets my creative juices flowing every month with a &amp;ldquo;prompt&amp;rdquo; to work into a design.
January&amp;rsquo;s prompt was &amp;ldquo;one word&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Nope&amp;rdquo; pretty much sums up my January.</description></item><item><title>Dave the Dachshund</title><link>/portfolio/dave-the-dachshund/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/dave-the-dachshund/</guid><description>I originally found this free pattern for &amp;ldquo;Dave the Dachshund&amp;rdquo; online from Sew Magazine after wanting to make a doorstop as a present for my sister&amp;rsquo;s birthday (it&amp;rsquo;s not just me that&amp;rsquo;s obsessed with dachshunds!).
After that make, I decided I wanted to make Dave again, but with this super cute avocado fabric! I&amp;rsquo;d never made a soft toy before and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more pleased with how he turned out.</description></item></channel></rss>
