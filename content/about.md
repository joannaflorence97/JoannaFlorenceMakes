<p class="intro-handwritten">Hi there!</p>

<p class="separator">I'm Joanna, keen sewist and crafter! Most days you can find me making something with the help of my assistant, my miniature dachshund Charlie.

I've always loved crafts and grew up knitting and cross stitching. In 2020 I discovered the joy of sewing and I've been hooked ever since. I am largely self-taught, having learnt a lot through the wonderful online sewing community.
