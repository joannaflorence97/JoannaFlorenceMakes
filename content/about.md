<p class="p-heading">Hi there!</p>

<p class="separator">I'm Joanna Florence, a twenty-five year old from Hertfordshire in the UK. Most days you can find me making something with the help of my assistant, my miniature dachshund Charlie.

I've always loved crafts and grew up enjoying knitting and cross-stitch. I bought my first sewing machine at the age of 17 (it was a mini John Lewis machine in bubblegum pink!) and I've been hooked on sewing ever since. I am largely self-taught, having learnt a lot through the wonderful online sewing community.

I taught myself to embroider throughout the first 2020 UK lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic. There is now nothing I find more therapeutic than sitting under a blanket on the sofa with an embroidery hoop.

On this website I post information about my latest sewing and embroidery makes, patterns, reviews, tutorials and more! For updates, follow my Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joannaflorencemakes">@joannaflorencemakes</a>
