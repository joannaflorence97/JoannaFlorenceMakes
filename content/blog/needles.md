Choosing the wrong needle for your project could be as detrimental as cutting all your pieces the wrong way around and not having enough fabric to recut them. In other words, it can make or break a project and damage your fabric beyond repair. 

This article is a beginner friendly guide to the different types of sewing machine needles available, and what works best for certain fabrics. There's also a handy cheat sheet to download which may help you each time you start a new project! 

The first thing to note is that some needles may only fit certain machines, whereas some needles are standardised. It's worth checking the labels when buying your needles so as not to be caught out by this! The main things you need to know about needles is a) the type and b) the size... then you're good to go!  

## Types of Needle  
Do not get overwhelmed! There are a lot of different types of needles. But you will find that you will use some a lot more than others, and some you may never even use.

These are the most commonly used needles and are a great all-rounder for any type of project. These are my go-to needle for any new project using woven fabric (such as cotton, satin, crepe etc.). 

### Ballpoint 
These have a rounded tip, making them an excellent choice for stretch fabrics.
