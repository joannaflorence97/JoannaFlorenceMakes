I absolutely love gothic-esque embroidery and I was inspired by the beautiful Mexican Day of the Dead sugar skulls to create this flowery skull pattern. I have stitched it in a 5" hoop but I also think it would look great on a tote bag, on a denim jacket, or as a patch.

You can download the pattern below. To fit the pattern in a 5" hoop make sure your printer does not scale the page, but feel free to scale if you would like the pattern to be smaller or larger.
