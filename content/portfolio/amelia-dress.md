I absolutely LOVE this pattern. It's The Amelia Tea Dress by Simple Sew... with a few hacks. Firstly, I added some big pockets and attached them in-seam at both the side seams and waist. Secondly, as I didn't have enough fabric for the original pattern I shortened the skirt pattern piece so I  was still able to cut out a full circle skirt.

Techniques I learnt in the process were:
1. Darts.
2. V-neckline with facing.
3. Adding sleeves to a garment.
4. A refresher on shirring.
5. Matching seams up properly when putting in an invisble zipper.

It's so comfortable and I can't wait to wear it in Summer.
