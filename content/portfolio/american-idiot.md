I've always been enamoured with this album artwork and I saw it as a good design to practice my satin stitch.

I restarted this piece three times. Originally I drew the design onto some black fabric but found it difficult to see the design accurately and so switched to calico and coloured the black background with a Sharpie. I kind of love the rusticity of it and I definitely wouldn't have got that with a plain black fabric.
