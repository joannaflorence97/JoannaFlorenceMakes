This is the second time I've made the Joni dress by Tilly and the Buttons. It's such a great pattern and the outcome is so gorgeous and comfortable at the same time due to the stretch. Last time I made it using the flared sleeve option, but this time I made fitted sleeves and extended them all the way down to my wrists. I'm so happy with the outcome... what a great Christmas party dress!
