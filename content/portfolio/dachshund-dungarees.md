I made these custom dungarees for my sister Jay, who is modelling them here. Don't you think she looks fab? The fabric is tapestry fabric covered in dachshunds! The pattern is K4138 by Kwik Sew. I have used the pattern before to sew the pinfore dress variation for myself. This took a lot of effort but I think it was worth it!
