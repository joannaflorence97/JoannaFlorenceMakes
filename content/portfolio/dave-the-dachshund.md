I originally found this free pattern for "Dave the Dachshund" online from [Sew Magazine](https://www.sewmag.co.uk/free-sewing-patterns/dave-dachshund-templates) after wanting to make a doorstop as a present for my sister's birthday (it's not just me that's obsessed with dachshunds!). 

After that make, I decided I wanted to make Dave again, but with this super cute avocado fabric! I'd never made a soft toy before and I couldn't be more pleased with how he turned out.
