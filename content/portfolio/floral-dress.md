This is actually the first dress I've successfully completed without giving up halfway through! I've had some sort of mental block about dresses until now. Iâ€™ve made plenty of tops and skirts but a dress just seemed like an entirely more difficult thing. 

The pattern used was New Look 6507 (view C... with the adition of a strap).

Techniques I learnt in the process were:
1. French seams.
2. Making bias binding.
3. Tricks for sewing over big chunky seams.
4. Narrow rolled hems.

Something I found frustrating was using the rolled hem presser foot. It's definitely something I need a lot more practice with!
