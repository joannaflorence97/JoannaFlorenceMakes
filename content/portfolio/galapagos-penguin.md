One of the reasons I got into embroidery in the first place was because I saw thread-painted animals on Instagram and thought that they looked absolutely beautiful. 

For a long while I put off this project because I was scared of doing an injustice to my favourite animal, the penguin. I couldn't be happier with how this turned out though!

This is a Galápagos penguin that I stitched as part of the February 2021 Endangered Species Challenge by [@rabbithatdesigns](https://www.instagram.com/rabbithatdesigns/). The background is watercolour on calico and the design was created by myself.
