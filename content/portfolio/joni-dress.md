The Joni pattern is by [Tilly and the Buttons](https://www.instagram.com/tillybuttons) and features in the book _Stretch!_.

I am IN LOVE with this dress. It features a flattering empire waistline with a beautiful twist on the front as well as a full circle skirt. I opted for the flared sleeve variation.
