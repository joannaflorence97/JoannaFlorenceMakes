Yet another gorgeous dress by [Tilly and the Buttons](https://www.instagram.com/tillybuttons)! 

The variations I went for were:
1) Knee length dress.
2) 3/4 length sleeves.
3) The optional waist tie.

The fabric I used was kindly gifted to me by [Minerva](https://minerva.com).    

I took my time to make this dress and I think because of that it turned out to be the best item that I have made to date!
