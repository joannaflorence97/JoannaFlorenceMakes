In 2021 I've been particpating in the monthly [@stitchthisinyourstyle](https://www.instagram.com/stitchthisinyourstyle/) challenge. I love this challenge because it really gets my creative juices flowing every month with a "prompt" to work into a design. 

January's prompt was "one word". "Nope" pretty much sums up my January.
