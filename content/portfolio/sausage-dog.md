My friend was getting rid of a load of old bed sheets and in them was this gorgeous duvet cover printed with dachshunds, spots, bones and paw prints.

I love recycling fabric and it was great to use this black and tan dachshund as a focal point for a decorative hoop. 

I've still got loads of the fabric left so it'll definitely feature again in the future!

Stitches used: Chain stitch, stem stitch, back stitch.
