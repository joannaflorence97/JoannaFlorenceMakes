This hoodie is so cosy, I never want to take it off!<br>
The pattern is Stella, from the book Stretch by Tilly and the Buttons.<br>
The fabric is French terry and was gifted to me by [Minerva](https://minerva.com). I also lined the hood in plain black fleece for extra cosiness! I added a pattern-matched kangaroo pocket on the front.
