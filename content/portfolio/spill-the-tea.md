In 2021 I've been particpating in the monthly [@stitchthisinyourstyle](https://www.instagram.com/stitchthisinyourstyle/) challenge. I love this challenge because it really gets my creative juices flowing every month with a "prompt" to work into a design. 

Febuary's prompt was "drink". Because Iâ€™m British I obviously had to do something involving #tea.
