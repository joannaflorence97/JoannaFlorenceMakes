When I saw this strawberry covered fabric I immediately thought about making a summery pinafore dress. Then when I saw this pattern for a pinafore dress with large pockets _and_ a pocket on the front I knew I had to make it! 

The pattern used was Kwik Sew K4318.

Techniques I learnt in the process were:
1. Sewing a lapped zip.
2. Turning corners neatly on an overlocker.
3. Stitch in the ditch. 
4. A refresher on gathering.
5. A refresher on using my machine to sew one-step buttonholes.

I also had a stark reminder not to grade seams too much or else things start falling apart!

I'll definitely be making this dress again. Perhaps in a fabric where I can stitch some pretty embroidery on it.
