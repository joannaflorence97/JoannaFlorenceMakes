It&amp;rsquo;s such a great pattern and the outcome is so gorgeous and comfortable at the same time due to the stretch. Last time I made it using the flared sleeve option, but this time I made fitted sleeves and extended them all the way down to my wrists. I&amp;rsquo;m so happy with the outcome&amp;hellip; what a great Christmas party dress!</description></item><item><title>Sewing Pattern Review: Lyra by Tilly and the Buttons</title><link>/blog/lyra-dress/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 11:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/lyra-dress/</guid><description>Yet another gorgeous dress by Tilly and the Buttons. This one features a relaxed waist with a button up front and shirt collar. The different options for sleeve length and dress length mean that this dress can be turned into an easy-to-wear summer dress just as easily as it can be turned into a toasty winter dress.
Rating: star star star -- The options I went for were:
The knee length variation.</description></item><item><title>Lyra Dress</title><link>/portfolio/lyra-dress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/lyra-dress/</guid><description>Yet another gorgeous dress by Tilly and the Buttons!
The variations I went for were:
Knee length dress. 3/4 length sleeves. The optional waist tie. The fabric I used was kindly gifted to me by Minerva.
I took my time to make this dress and I think because of that it turned out to be the best item that I have made to date!</description></item><item><title>Sewing Pattern Review: Winslow Culottes by Helen's Closet</title><link>/blog/winslow-culottes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 11:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/winslow-culottes/</guid><description>The Winslow Culottes are a beginner-friendly pattern by Helen&amp;rsquo;s Closet, featuring box pleats and an invisible zipper at the back. This is the first pattern that I’ve bought from Helen’s Closet and I have to say that I am super impressed. The pattern comes with four different length options. The one I chose to sew is view A (the shortest) but I’m definitely going to make some more in longer lengths.</description></item><item><title>Joni Dress</title><link>/portfolio/joni-dress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/joni-dress/</guid><description>The Joni pattern is by Tilly and the Buttons and features in the book Stretch!.
I am IN LOVE with this dress. It features a flattering empire waistline with a beautiful twist on the front as well as a full circle skirt. I opted for the flared sleeve variation.</description></item><item><title>Self Drafted Shirred Top</title><link>/portfolio/shirred-top/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/shirred-top/</guid><description>This pattern was entirely self drafted - yay!
The bodice was so simple to make and started as just two rectangles! The shirring took a long time but it creates a great fit and is so easy to wear.
My overlocker was in for repair when I made this so it was a great chance to practice my French seams!</description></item><item><title>Sewing Pattern Review: Joni by Tilly and the Buttons</title><link>/blog/joni-dress/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jun 2021 11:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/joni-dress/</guid><description>The Joni pattern is by Tilly and the Buttons and features in the book Stretch!.
Rating: star star star -- I am IN LOVE with this dress. It features a flattering empire waistline with a beautiful twist on the front as well as a full circle skirt. The pattern also comes with a choice of sleeves to choose from: three-quarter length, elbow-length, flared or even ruched.
I opted for the flared sleeves, although I didn&amp;rsquo;t make them as flared as suggested in the book.</description></item><item><title>Brighter Days Ahead Rainbow</title><link>/portfolio/brighter-days/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/brighter-days/</guid><description>This beautiful design is by Niamh Wimperis. I saw it on the cover of Mollie Makes magazine and knew I had to stitch it. I gifted it to my auntie for her birthday</description></item><item><title>Tilly and the Buttons: Safiya Trousers</title><link>/blog/safiya-trousers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 11:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/safiya-trousers/</guid><description>This pattern is included in the Make it Simple Tilly and the Buttons book that I got for my birthday recently! I&amp;rsquo;ve never made a pair of trousers before (unless you count PJs) and due to the temperature getting warmer and the sun coming out I thought I should make some nice lightweight summer trousers.
The fabric used is a linen-cotton mix from Pound Fabrics and it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely perfect for lightweight summer clothes.</description></item><item><title>Safiya Trousers</title><link>/portfolio/safiya-trousers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/safiya-trousers/</guid><description>These are the Safiya Trousers from the Tilly and the Button&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;Make it Simple&amp;rdquo;. They are super comfy. As the book says, it&amp;rsquo;s almost like I&amp;rsquo;m secretly wearing pyjamas!
With this pattern I also succeeded at pattern matching for the first time - yay!</description></item><item><title>Tilly and the Buttons: Tabitha T-Shirt</title><link>/blog/tabitha-t-shirt/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 11:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/tabitha-t-shirt/</guid><description>I've been wanting to try out a Tilly and the Buttons pattern for a while now. I&amp;rsquo;m constantly looking at their Instagram page, and loving how aesthetically pleasing it is! I love how they cater to all skill levels and I refer to their blog and Youtube channel frequently because of how clearly everything is explained.
I got the &amp;ldquo;Make it Simple&amp;rdquo; Tilly and the Buttons book for my birthday recently and immediately went through the book sticking post-it flags on the pages of the patterns I wanted to try first.</description></item><item><title>Sewing Pattern Review: The Great British Sewing Bee Shell Top</title><link>/blog/shell-top/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 11:00:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/shell-top/</guid><description>Shell tops aren't really my style but after watching the first episode of The Great British Sewing Bee, series 7, I felt inspired to make one myself. I was mainly intrigued by the &amp;ldquo;bagging out&amp;rdquo; technique for the facing which I had never tried and wanted to learn.
The pattern I used is free to download as a PDF and is a very similar shell top to the one used in the episode.</description></item><item><title>Sewing Pattern Review: The Amelia Tea Dress</title><link>/blog/amelia-tea-dress/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 11:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/amelia-tea-dress/</guid><description>Not only is this 50's inspired vintage tea dress absolutely beautiful but the shirred waist and fluttery sleeves make it super comfortable and perfect for the summer.
The fabric used was from the sale at Pound Fabrics and is a lightweight polyester. It was easy and enjoyable to sew with (after I realised that some of my pins were ruining it so I stopped using them!).
The pattern was easy to follow although I found that there were a few small steps not included such as adding understitching to the neckline facing as well as how to neatly finish seams.</description></item><item><title>The Amelia Tea Dress</title><link>/portfolio/amelia-dress/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/amelia-dress/</guid><description>I absolutely LOVE this pattern. It&amp;rsquo;s The Amelia Tea Dress by Simple Sew&amp;hellip; with a few hacks. Firstly, I added some big pockets and attached them in-seam at both the side seams and waist. Secondly, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough fabric for the original pattern I shortened the skirt pattern piece so I was still able to cut out a full circle skirt.
Techniques I learnt in the process were:</description></item><item><title>Free Embroidery Pattern: Flowery Skull</title><link>/blog/skull-pattern/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 11:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/skull-pattern/</guid><description>I absolutely love gothic-esque embroidery and I was inspired by the beautiful Mexican Day of the Dead sugar skulls to create this flowery skull pattern. I have stitched it in a 5&amp;quot; hoop on calico fabric but I also think it would look great on a tote bag, on a denim jacket, or as a patch.
You can download the pattern below. To fit the pattern in a 5&amp;quot; hoop make sure your printer does not scale the page, but feel free to scale if you would like the pattern to be smaller or larger.</description></item><item><title>Strawberry Pinafore Dress</title><link>/portfolio/strawberry-dress/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Mar 2021 10:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/strawberry-dress/</guid><description>When I saw this strawberry covered fabric I immediately thought about making a summery pinafore dress. Then when I saw this pattern for a pinafore dress with large pockets and a pocket on the front I knew I had to make it!
The pattern used was Kwik Sew K4318.
Techniques I learnt in the process were:
Sewing a lapped zip. Turning corners neatly on an overlocker. Stitch in the ditch.</description></item><item><title>I love my dachshund!</title><link>/portfolio/sausage-dog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/sausage-dog/</guid><description>My friend was getting rid of a load of old bed sheets and in them was this gorgeous duvet cover printed with dachshunds, spots, bones and paw prints.
I love recycling fabric and it was great to use this black and tan dachshund as a focal point for a decorative hoop.
I&amp;rsquo;ve still got loads of the fabric left so it&amp;rsquo;ll definitely feature again in the future!
Stitches used: Chain stitch, stem stitch, back stitch.</description></item><item><title>Monochrome Blue</title><link>/portfolio/monochrome-girl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/monochrome-girl/</guid><description>In 2021 I&amp;rsquo;ve been particpating in the monthly @stitchthisinyourstyle challenge. I love this challenge because it really gets my creative juices flowing every month with a &amp;ldquo;prompt&amp;rdquo; to work into a design.
March&amp;rsquo;s prompt was &amp;ldquo;monochrome&amp;rdquo; so I stitched this &amp;ldquo;blue&amp;rdquo; girl using several different shades of blue.</description></item><item><title>Floral Asymmetrical Dress</title><link>/portfolio/floral-dress/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/floral-dress/</guid><description>This is actually the first dress I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully completed without giving up halfway through! I&amp;rsquo;ve had some sort of mental block about dresses until now. I’ve made plenty of tops and skirts but a dress just seemed like an entirely more difficult thing.
The pattern used was New Look 6507 (view C&amp;hellip; with the adition of a strap).
Techniques I learnt in the process were:
French seams. Making bias binding.</description></item><item><title>Galápagos penguin</title><link>/portfolio/galapagos-penguin/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/galapagos-penguin/</guid><description>One of the reasons I got into embroidery in the first place was because I saw thread-painted animals on Instagram and thought that they looked absolutely beautiful.
For a long while I put off this project because I was scared of doing an injustice to my favourite animal, the penguin. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier with how this turned out though!
This is a Galápagos penguin that I stitched as part of the February 2021 Endangered Species Challenge by @rabbithatdesigns.</description></item><item><title>A Sleepy Sloth</title><link>/portfolio/sloth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/sloth/</guid><description>I recently subscribed to Love Embroidery magazine and this beautiful pattern came in issue 10 (January 2021).

I'm Joanna Florence, a twenty-five year old from Hertfordshire in the UK. Most days you can find me making something with the help of my assistant, my miniature dachshund Charlie. I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved crafts and grew up enjoying knitting and cross-stitch. I bought my first sewing machine at the age of 17 (it was a mini John Lewis machine in bubblegum pink!) and I&amp;rsquo;ve been hooked on sewing ever since.</description></item><item><title>Welcome message</title><link>/welcomemessage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/welcomemessage/</guid><description>DESIGN .

Febuary&amp;rsquo;s prompt was &amp;ldquo;drink&amp;rdquo;.

Something I loved about doing this piece was the lettering. It took hours but it was so theraputic and totally worth it.</description></item><item><title>Green Day Album Art</title><link>/portfolio/american-idiot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/american-idiot/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been enamoured with this album artwork and I saw it as a good design to practice my satin stitch.
I restarted this piece three times. Originally I drew the design onto some black fabric but found it difficult to see the design accurately and so switched to calico and coloured the black background with a Sharpie. I kind of love the rusticity of it and I definitely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have got that with a plain black fabric.</description></item><item><title>Nope</title><link>/portfolio/nope/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/nope/</guid><description>In 2021 I&amp;rsquo;ve been particpating in the monthly @stitchthisinyourstyle challenge.

January&amp;rsquo;s prompt was &amp;ldquo;one word&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Nope&amp;rdquo; pretty much sums up my January.</description></item><item><title>Dave the Dachshund</title><link>/portfolio/dave-the-dachshund/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/dave-the-dachshund/</guid><description>I originally found this free pattern for &amp;ldquo;Dave the Dachshund&amp;rdquo; online from Sew Magazine after wanting to make a doorstop as a present for my sister&amp;rsquo;s birthday (it&amp;rsquo;s not just me that&amp;rsquo;s obsessed with dachshunds!).
After that make, I decided I wanted to make Dave again, but with this super cute avocado fabric! I&amp;rsquo;d never made a soft toy before and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more pleased with how he turned out.</description></item></channel></rss>
